# Assets

To ensure that RocketBlend can function properly, it needs to have access to specific details about a given build, addon, or `.blend` file. These details are provided through a metadata file called an **Asset**, which is a `.json` file stored alongside the item in question.

## Types of asset

There are currently 3 different types of assets; Builds, Packages, and Rocketfiles.

### Builds

{% content-ref url="builds.md" %}
[builds.md](builds.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Packages

{% content-ref url="packages.md" %}
[packages.md](packages.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Rocketfiles

{% content-ref url="rocketfiles.md" %}
[rocketfiles.md](rocketfiles.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
