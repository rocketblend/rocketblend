description: Add a local package directly into your library
---

# Insert

## Synopsis

Allows for `rocketpacks.yaml` to be directly inserted into your library without the need to host it in a remote repository. This can be useful for testing package definitions or for purchased addons that don't have a public download source.&#x20;

```shell-session
$ rocketblend insert [reference]
```

## Options

### Options inherited from parent commands

```shell-session
  -d, --directory string   working directory for the command (default ".")
  -v, --verbose            enable verbose logging
```
