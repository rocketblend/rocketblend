# Introduction to RocketBlend

## What is RocketBlend?

[RocketBlend ](https://github.com/rocketblend/rocketblend)is an open-source tool that offers package and version management for the 3D graphics software, [Blender](https://www.blender.org/). It consists of two parts: a CLI tool and a Launcher.

### CLI

The command line tool is the primary application for managing your local installations of packages and Blender versions.

### Launcher

The Launcher is an alternative launcher for `.blend` files that utilizes a `rocketfile.json` file to determine the correct version of Blender and the packages to run.

The Launcher is optional, but it allows you to open .blend files as you normally would while still maintaining package and build management.
{% endhint %}
