# Installation

{% hint style="info" %}
We're still working on adding RocketBlend to package managers like Homebrew and Chocolatey. Stay tuned for updates.
{% endhint %}

## Source

Currently, the best way to start using rocketblend is via `go install`. You'll need `go` to be installed and `GOBIN` in your `PATH`. Once that is done, run the command:

```shell-session
$ go install github.com/rocketblend/rocketblend@latest
```

## Pre-compiled binaries

Get them [here](https://github.com/rocketblend/rocketblend/releases).
